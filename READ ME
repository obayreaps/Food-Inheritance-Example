What I learned

In main driver, functions do not have parameters with datatypes.
For example, func(name, origin, rating...)

You create an object by assigning class name to function that's being declared. Then you can access the member function through an object
For example, Food wholefood(...
            wholefood.displayInfo

Inheritance is the act of designating members of an existing class to a new class. So you don't have to create new members. 

Thus class Sweet : public Food (inherits food, name, rating...)

Constructors are USEFUL in Class.cpp files. I learn to assign members from main.cpp to private members in head file. 
For ex   funct(...
        :name(name) // priv data <== var from main.cpp

Ternary operator (condition ? choice1 : choice2);
